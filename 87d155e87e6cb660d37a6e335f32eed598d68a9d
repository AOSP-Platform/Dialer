The Dialer team is now switching to a public development model similar to the telephony team.\n\nThis CL represents all internal Google changes that were committed to Dialer between the public O release and today\u0027s tip of tree on internal master.\n\nThis CL squashes those changes into a single commit. In subsequent changes, changes will be exported on a per-commit basis.",
