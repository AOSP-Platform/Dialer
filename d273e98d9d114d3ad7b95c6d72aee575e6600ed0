It means that if the device\u0027s time zone changes while the code is running it won\u0027t be reflected here (e.g. until the process is restarted). Changing default time zone is a relatively rare event, so not an easily found or experienced bug.\n\nLooks like it was a \"problem\" previously too, so not a regression.",
