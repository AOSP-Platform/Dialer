This is a very early draft of the dialer team style guide.

JAVA STYLE
TODO(sail): Remove this and switch to an autoformatter for all new code.

1. Imports should be sorted.

2. Member variables should be sorted in the following order:
    - static finals
    - static
    - final
    - everything else

CODING BEST PRACTICES

1. Singletons
   - Don't use singletons. Have objects be passed in. Rare exceptions could be
     made for things like Services.

2. Finals
   - Don't use finals for local variables.

3. Member variables
    - Don't cache anything in member variables that can be derived when needed.

4. Comments
    - Avoid comments when possible. Possibly alternatives to comments:
        - expressive variable names
        - expressive function names
    - Comments that repeat function names or class names or variable names are
      banned.

5. Unit tests
    - All new classes must have unit tests.
    - When adding code to an existing class check if that class has tests. If so
      then unit tests are required for the newly added code.

6. Threading
    - Avoid multi-threaded code. Data should be passed to a background task
      instead.
    - Use of "synchronized" and locks are banned. Rare exceptions are permitted
      specially when dealing with legacy code.

7. Crash when possible
    - Silently working around errors should be avoided. Crashes are preferred.
